                        <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Apps such as Spotify have different layouts and features on smartphones compared to desktops, leading to inefficiencies when switching devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Synchronization:</strong> Changes made on one device, like editing a playlist, may not reflect immediately on others, causing delays or duplicate work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardware Limitations:</strong> Older or budget-friendly devices may struggle with rendering high-quality content, such as 4K videos or immersive gaming, due to limited processing power or display capabilities.</li>
